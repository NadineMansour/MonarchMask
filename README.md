# MonarchMask Browser Extension

## Overview
MonarchMask is a browser extension that provides intelligent numeric privacy protection when screen sharing and browsing sensitive content. It selectively masks financial and personal data to maintain your privacy without disrupting your browsing experience.

## Problem Solved
When sharing your screen during presentations, video calls, or recordings, you might accidentally expose sensitive financial information like account balances, transaction amounts, or budget numbers. MonarchMask solves this problem by automatically masking:

- Numbers with currency symbols ($, €, £, ¥)
- Numbers with percentage signs (%)

While leaving other numbers (dates, product IDs, etc.) visible for a better browsing experience.

## Features
- **Selective Masking**: Only masks numbers with currency or percentage symbols
- **Intelligent Detection**: Recognizes financial data in various formats
- **Focus on Privacy**: Specifically designed for financial applications and websites like Monarch Money
- **Simple Toggle**: Easy to enable/disable as needed
- **Non-intrusive**: Only affects visual display, not the actual data
